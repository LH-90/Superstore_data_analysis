# Superstore Data Analysis

This repository contains a dataset named "Superstore_dataset.csv" that provides information about products sold from 2014 to 2017 in a superstore located in the US. 
Additionally, we have used a "geo_location.csv" dataset to obtain the latitude and longitude of each city.

## Essential Steps of EDA
We will perform the 3 essential steps of Exploratory Data Analysis using the Pandas library:

### 1. Data Exploration
We initially recommend exploring the variables in Excel to get a good understanding of the dataset.
Next, we import the dataset using the Python Pandas library and use various key exploration commands to gain insights into the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning
If necessary, we remove any rows that have missing values to ensure the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.
Please note that we have decided not to remove any outliers at this stage, further investigation is required before making decisions on outlier treatment.

### 3. Data Analysis
In this step, we answer some specific questions related to the dataset using appropriate graphs and visualisations to provide meaningful insights.
We have used Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.

## Instructions
To run the analysis code, open the file "Superstore_project" on google colab and follow the steps.
